Please analyze this codebase and create an AGENT.md file containing:
1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
2. Architecture and codebase structure information, including important subprojects, internal APIs, databases, etc.
3. Code style guidelines, including imports, conventions, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.

The file you create will be given to agentic coding tools (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 20 lines long.

If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules), Claude rules (CLAUDE.md), Windsurf rules (.windsurfrules), Cline rules (.clinerules), Goose rules (.goosehints), or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them. Also, first check if there is a AGENT.md file, and if so, update it instead of overwriting it.
