After analyzing the code, I've identified several areas for improvement. Here are 5 constructive suggestions:

1. Extract Configuration Management into a Dedicated Class
The load_config() method is doing too much - parsing config files, calculating regions, and building complex nested dictionaries. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle.

Benefits: Better testability, easier configuration validation, cleaner separation of concerns, and simplified maintenance when config requirements change.

class ConfigManager:
    def __init__(self, config_path="configs/config.ini"):
        self.config_path = config_path
        self.parser = configparser.ConfigParser()
    
    def load(self):
        # Dedicated methods for each config section
        pass
    
    def get_screen_region(self):
        # Extract region calculation logic
        pass

2. Implement Proper Resource Management with Context Managers
The code creates resources like mss.mss(), OpenCV windows, and threads without consistent cleanup patterns. The detection loop manually manages mss.mss() but other parts don't follow this pattern.

Benefits: Prevents resource leaks, ensures proper cleanup even during exceptions, and makes the code more reliable in production environments.

class CVTargetingSystem:
    def __enter__(self):
        return self
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.cleanup()
    
    def cleanup(self):
        # Proper resource cleanup
        if self.overlay:
            self.overlay.cleanup()
        cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Copy

main.py
3. Replace Direct User Input with Command Pattern
The run() method uses blocking input() calls and has hardcoded UI logic mixed with business logic. This makes testing difficult and limits flexibility.

Benefits: Better testability, cleaner separation of UI and business logic, easier to add new commands or interfaces, and non-blocking operation.

class CommandHandler:
    def __init__(self, system):
        self.system = system
        self.commands = {
            "1": self.launch_gui,
            "2": self.launch_overlay,
            "q": self.quit
        }
    
    def handle_command(self, cmd):
        return self.commands.get(cmd, self.invalid_command)()

Apply

command_handler.py
4. Implement Proper Error Recovery and Circuit Breaker Pattern
The detection loop has basic exception handling but continues running even after repeated failures. This could lead to resource waste and poor user experience.

Benefits: Better system stability, prevents cascading failures, provides meaningful feedback to users, and allows graceful degradation of functionality.

class DetectionCircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=30):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.recovery_timeout = recovery_timeout
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN

Copy

Apply

main.py
5. Decouple Threading Logic with Producer-Consumer Pattern
The threading implementation is tightly coupled with the main class, making it hard to test and modify. The overlay loop thread is created inline without proper lifecycle management.

Benefits: Better testability, cleaner separation of concerns, easier to modify threading behavior, and more robust thread lifecycle management.

class DetectionPipeline:
    def __init__(self, detector, predictor, input_ctrl):
        self.detector = detector
        self.predictor = predictor
        self.input_ctrl = input_ctrl
        self.frame_queue = queue.Queue(maxsize=2)
        self.result_queue = queue.Queue(maxsize=10)
    
    def start(self):
        # Managed thread creation and lifecycle
        pass

Copy

Apply

detection_pipeline.py
Summary
The code shows good understanding of the problem domain and implements complex functionality, but suffers from common maintainability issues found in rapidly developed systems. The main concerns are:

High coupling between components makes testing and modification difficult
Mixed responsibilities within classes violate SOLID principles
Resource management could be more robust
Error handling needs improvement for production reliability
The core algorithms and integration patterns are sound, but refactoring toward better separation of concerns and proper resource management would significantly improve the codebase's long-term maintainability and reliability.
